 As **Senior Software Engineer** in the**Search** and**Discovery Team,**you will be tasked with optimising the search and navigation across of one of Australia’s most sort after design businesses.

**About the Company** This Sydney-based global design company (backed by Airtree) that empowers small businesses to build their brand instantly. With a loyal customer base in Australia and the US, they are now focused on making their platform the best in the world.

 The company has just rebranded their small-business branding application, anticipating more traffic and engagement. They are already leveraging AI, and have a dedicated AI team to develop image-based generative AI, keeping them ahead of the competition.

 Their office is in Surry Hills, but they value flexibility. Most of the team comes in one day a fortnight, and they have monthly team events. If you prefer the office, there's a core group that goes in regularly, and they even have a coffee tab next door!

**About the Role** This company is looking for a Senior Engineer to join their Agile, quality-focused team. You'll drive developing and improving a large customer-facing platform, handling tasks from database design to integration development.

 Experience with **Elasticsearch** is essential to optimise search functionality, ensuring fast, scalable, and accurate results for users. Prior **data analytics experience** will also be crucial for improving the platform's search capabilities, allowing deeper insights into customer behaviors and enhancing overall search performance to deliver a superior user experience.

 You'll build and deploy new functionalities, support existing features, enhance site scalability, infrastructure, and testing, all in a highly collaborative environment.

 They have weekly highlight and feature meetings, perfect for showcasing your work and staying updated on product developments.

**Got the tech?**

*   Elasticsearch or Opensearch (Bonus if you have this but a keen interest if not is a must)
*   .Net Core
*   Cloud
*   CI/CD
*   Event Driven Architecture as it relates to Microservices

*   Equity in the company
*   Career progression in a fast-growing company
