About This Opportunity
----------------------

ESE Recruitment is partnering with a **world-renowned global leader in science and engineering R&D** to find an exceptional Technical Writer for their Atomic, Molecular, and Raman Spectroscopy division in Melbourne. This is a **permanent, full-time position** offering genuine career progression with an industry-leading organisation.

Our client is looking for someone special – you'll be one of a very small team of technical writers working directly alongside a documentation lead with nearly two decades at the company.

This is a chance to build a lasting career while making an immediate impact in a collaborative, innovation-driven environment where your documentation work directly supports customer success.

Why This Role Stands Out
------------------------

You'll be creating and maintaining user documentation – both printed and online – that transforms complex technical content spanning software, chemistry, and hardware into clear, accessible materials that customers rely on daily. The variety is genuine, working across the entire product lifecycle and collaborating with marketing, R&D, quality assurance, manufacturing, and external vendors.

**What you'll be doing:**

*   Researching, planning, and developing comprehensive user documentation including manuals, getting started guides, software help systems, tutorials, and video demonstrations

*   Converting highly technical language into 'bite-sized' content that enables users to self-serve quickly and effectively

*   Collaborating with subject matter experts across software, hardware, and scientific teams to understand technology and applications

*   Analysing user needs and organising information for maximum clarity and accessibility

*   Managing documentation version control, regulatory compliance (ISO and other guidelines), and customer accessibility

*   Working with translators and external agencies as needed

*   Running multiple projects simultaneously with minimal supervision, often to tight deadlines

*   Maintaining close contact with global teams across the organisation

*   Proactively identifying process improvements during variable workload periods

The Ideal Candidate
-------------------

**Must-haves:**

*   **Demonstrated experience** in technical writing, particularly for STEM or engineering audiences

*   **Microsoft Office skills** – especially MS Word including templates, styles, and advanced formatting

*   **HTML knowledge** – you'll be tested on this

*   **Content editors** such as Adobe Dreamweaver, RoboHelp, or similar HTML-based documentation tools (experience with open-source tools is acceptable)

*   **Desktop publishing** applications such as Adobe FrameMaker and Creative Suite

*   **Video editing tools** such as Adobe Premiere Pro or TechSmith Camtasia and Articulate Storyline

*   **Understanding of CSS** and web-based documentation workflows

*   **Proactive, deadline-oriented approach** with exceptional organisational and project management skills

**Strongly preferred:**

*   **BA/BS in Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, Engineering** or equivalent (or demonstrated technical comprehension if from a different background)

**Bonus points for:**

*   **Knowledge of spectroscopy techniques** such as AA, ICP-OES, FTIR, UV-Vis

*   Experience with atomic content or molecular documentation

*   Native English speaker or demonstrably excellent written and spoken English

What Our Client Really Values
-----------------------------

Beyond the technical checklist, we're seeking someone who:

*   **Writes authentically** – we want to see your genuine writing voice in your cover letter and samples (no AI-generated content)

*   **Demonstrates exceptional clarity** – the ability to distill complex information into bite-sized content people can understand and act on quickly

*   **Seeks permanency** – we don't want someone who uses this role as a stepping stone or is mainly interested in contract work (genuine commitment only)

*   **Brings collaborative energy** – you'll be working in a close-knit team

*   **Works independently after training** – you'll run projects end-to-end with minimal supervision once you're up to speed

The Work Environment
--------------------

This position is a day-time role with no travel required. It starts **predominantly on-site** to facilitate proper integration, training, and relationship-building with the Melbourne team. **Hybrid work is available**, but only after you've demonstrated professionalism and can work effectively independently. The transition is performance-based and happens naturally as you prove your capability.

The documentation work is genuinely varied – new product launches and ongoing maintenance across the organisation's global customer base – in a fast-paced, innovation-driven environment. All documentation goes through rigorous sign-off processes including R&D, regulatory compliance (ISO standards), and technical review to ensure the highest quality.

Package and Benefits
--------------------

This is a **permanent, full-time position** (no end date) with competitive remuneration determined by role, level, and location. We'll discuss specific salary details and benefits with shortlisted candidates.

About Our Client
----------------

Our client is a world-renowned global leader in scientific instrumentation and laboratory solutions. This role sits within their Atomic, Molecular, and Raman Spectroscopy division – cutting-edge technology serving customers worldwide. They are an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity and inclusion in all hiring practices.

Interview Process
-----------------

*   Initial phone chat and then video interview with ESE Recruitment

*   Client interview with shortlisted candidates including a writing and HTML assessment

*   Should we find ourselves with two or more equally qualified candidates, we may arrange an additional client interview to make the final decision

How to Apply
------------

If this sounds like your next career move, we want to hear from you.

**Your application should include:**

*   Current CV highlighting your technical writing experience, technical proficiency, and including relevant writing samples

*   **A cover letter in your authentic voice** – please don't use AI to generate this. Our client specifically wants to see your genuine writing style and how you express yourself
